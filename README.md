# Power Generation Modules

We are creating a modular power generation system that can be configured based on what power sources are available. The system is easily portable and can make use of multiple forms of power generation simultaneously. The generator modules that we have created so far include a hand crank, a wind turbine, and a water turbine. We have also built a battery/USB charger module and a lantern module to accompany the generator modules. Other potential modules include photovoltaic panels, concentrated solar power (CSP), or Peltier modules to extract energy from a fire or other heat source.

This project builds hope by allowing people living in places where power is not readily available to power and charge their electronic devices.
